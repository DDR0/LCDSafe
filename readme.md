## LCDSafe LCD Scrubs Scheduler
For Linux

### About
Run `./run-scrubs` to schedule a brief LCDscrub every hour. Save your plasma television from images being burned-in!

### The Story
We wanted to throw Twitch Plays Pokemon up on the TV, didn't want to burn in the gui like we did with Shoot Many Robots. This script saves your TV by running LCDscrub for five second every hour.

### Useage
Pull. Enter directory. Run `./run-scrubs.sh`. If that fails, run `./install`, which will install xscreensaver. If you prefer to use another screensaver system, you can run `./exit-xscreensaver.sh` when you're done.
